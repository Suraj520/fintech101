## Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Lending

P2P lending platforms connect individual borrowers directly with lenders, cutting out traditional banking intermediaries. Borrowers can access loans more easily, while lenders can earn returns by investing in loans. Examples include Lending Club and Prosper in the US, and Faircent in India.

## Robo-Advisory

Robo-advisors are online platforms that use algorithms to provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with minimal human intervention. They offer personalized investment recommendations and portfolio management based on an individual's financial goals and risk tolerance. Examples include Betterment and Wealthfront in the US, and Scripbox and Kuvera in India.

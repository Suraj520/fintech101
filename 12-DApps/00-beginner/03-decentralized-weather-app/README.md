### Additional Notes:
- Ensure you have the `WeatherStationABI.json` file in your project and it contains the ABI of your WeatherStation contract. You can find this ABI in the `build/contracts/WeatherStation.json` file generated by Truffle after compiling your contract.
- Replace `'YourDeployedContractAddress'` with the actual address where your contract is deployed. This address is available after you deploy your contract to a network (e.g., Ganache, Rinkeby).
- This example uses async/await syntax for Ethereum transactions and calls. Make sure to handle errors appropriately to improve user experience.
- Remember to enable MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet provider in your browser to interact with the Ethereum network.

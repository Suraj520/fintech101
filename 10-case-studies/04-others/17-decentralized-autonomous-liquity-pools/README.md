19. **Decentralized Autonomous Liquidity Pools (DALPs)**
    - Design and deploy Decentralized Autonomous Liquidity Pools (DALPs) that autonomously manage liquidity provision and market-making activities on decentralized exchanges (DEX).
    - Utilize automated strategies, such as impermanent loss mitigation, dynamic pricing, and liquidity rebalancing, to optimize liquidity pool performance.
    - Implement governance mechanisms to enable community-driven decision-making and protocol upgrades for DALPs.
